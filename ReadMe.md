### Scribe's Oath ðŸ‘‹

I, Daniel Wilkowski, hereby declare on a scribe's oath, to strive for the highest quality. I will keep true to the oath, as long as I craft software.

1. I will not produce harmful code.
2. The code that I produce will always be my best work. I will not knowingly allow code that is defective either in behaviour or structure to accumulate.
3. I will provide, with each release, a quick, sure, and repeatable proof that every element of the code works as it should.
4. I will make frequent, small, releases. I will not impede progress.
5. I will fearlessly and relentlessly improve my creations at every opportunity. I will never degrade them.
6. I will do all that I can to keep the productivity, mine and my collaborators, as high as possible.  I will do nothing that decreases productivity.
7. I will continuously ensure that others can cover for me, and that I can cover for them.
8. I will produce estimates that are honest both in magnitude and precision. I will not make promises without certainty.
9. I will never stop learning and improving my craft.

*Scribe's Oath was postulated by Robert Martin.*
